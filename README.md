# road-satellite-image-generation
Final project for MIT's 6.8300 (Advances in Computer Vision), for which we train a ControlNet for Stable Diffusion. Our condition is road masks of satellite images, and to train this condition, we gather data from the DeepGlobe challenge (see http://deepglobe.org/challenge.html).
